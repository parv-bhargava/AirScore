# List of SMART Questions for Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dataset 

We can select any 4 from here

## Specific
- What are the specific factors highly correlated with passenger satisfaction in this dataset?
- Can we identify specific attributes that are more strongly associated with satisfied passengers than dissatisfied ones?

## Measurable
- How can we measure the level of satisfaction in passengers? Is it quantifiable based on the attributes in the dataset?
- Is there a quantifiable relationship between flight distance and passenger satisfaction?
  - JB note on above two: not sure about characterizing relationships/results as "quantifiable" in this context since there   will be numerical output regardless of how well or poorly we model the relationship, I think we should focus more on how      certain variables are processed in the model or whether we can say with confidence that certain variable units (such as individual ratings) have measurable increments
- JB: How do we encode categorical variables in an appropriate manner for predictive validity?

### Bias
- Are there any biases in the data collection process that might affect the analysis and conclusions drawn from this dataset?
- Can we ~measure~ identify, measure, and mitigate potential biases in the dataset, such as gender bias or bias in customer type?

### Quantifiable? Data-Driven?
- How can we quantitatively measure the impact of inflight wifi service, online booking, and other factors on passenger satisfaction?
- Is our analysis data-driven, and can we provide data-backed recommendations to improve satisfaction levels?

## Achievable
- Do we have the necessary computing power and resources to perform predictive modeling and analysis on this dataset?
- ~Can we achieve a predictive model for passenger satisfaction with the available data and computational resources?~
- JB: Can we reliably predict passenger satisfaction with the available survey data?

## Relevant
- Does this dataset address the need to understand what factors contribute to passenger satisfaction in the airline industry?
- How relevant are these satisfaction factors to improving the overall customer experience for the airline?
- JB: Is our model interpretable and actionable for airlines?

## Time-Oriented
- What is the deadline for completing the analysis of this dataset and presenting actionable insights to the airline?
- Can we establish a timeline for implementing changes based on the findings from this dataset to enhance passenger satisfaction?
- JB: Could relevance for any of the surveyed factors diminish with future advances in technology?
