## Research Topic Proposals
Our research focuses on analyzing factors affecting airline passenger satisfaction. We will utilize a survey dataset that contains various aspects of the airline flight experience to evaluate its suitability for creating a logistic regression model predicting passenger satisfaction. This research can be valuable for airlines looking to enhance their customers' experiences and compete effectively in the industry.

We will leverage a dataset that includes surveyed passenger characteristics, flight details, and satisfaction ratings for select pre-flight and in-flight components. To ensure modeling suitability, we will conduct exploratory data analysis, taking into account variable distributions and types.

## SMART Questions
Our research aims to answer the following questions:

1. **To what extent do certain surveyed passenger characteristics and flight experience components impact the likelihood that a passenger will be satisfied – rather than neutral or dissatisfied – with their trip?**

2. **How can we model the likelihood of passenger satisfaction using surveyed passenger characteristics and flight experience components in a manner that minimizes predictive bias?**

3. **To what extent can we predict the likelihood that a flight passenger will be satisfied with their experience using multiple different variable levels?**

## Data Source
We will use the [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) dataset for our research. This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains information related to airline passenger satisfaction. It comprises 103,904 rows and 25 columns.
